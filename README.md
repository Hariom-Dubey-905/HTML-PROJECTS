HTML-PROJECTS

This repository contains simple and clean web pages built using HTML as part of my learning journey in frontend web development. These projects are created to practice the fundamentals of web structure, elements, and semantic tags. Each page is designed with basic layout and formatting to enhance my understanding of how HTML works in real-world scenarios.
